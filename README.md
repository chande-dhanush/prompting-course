## üìù MODULE 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering
**Objectives:**
- Understand what prompt engineering is and why it matters for AI agents.
- Learn basic principles for crafting effective prompts.

**Topics:**
- What are prompts and AI agents?
- The role of prompt engineering in digital marketing automations.
- Basic prompt structures: instructions, context, output formatting.

**Sample Questions:**
- **Basic:** What is a "prompt" in the context of AI and n8n?  
- **Basic:** Give an example of a prompt that clearly instructs an AI to summarize a blog post.

## üõ† MODULE 2: Foundations of Prompt Crafting
**Objectives:**
- Practice creating, refining, and testing simple prompts for AI tasks.

**Topics:**
- Types of prompts: descriptive, instructive, generative (content, summaries, Q&A, etc.)
- Common pitfalls: ambiguity, lack of context, unclear output format.

**Exercises:**
- Create prompts for generating:
  - A social media caption  
  - An email subject line  
  - A product description  
- Refine prompts for clarity and specificity.

**Sample Questions:**
- **Basic:** Rewrite this prompt to make it more specific: "Write a product description."  
- **Intermediate:** Design a prompt for an AI agent that generates a friendly reply to a customer‚Äôs FAQ.

## ‚öô MODULE 3: Prompt Engineering in n8n Workflows (Beginner Level)
**Objectives:**
- Connect n8n triggers and LLM nodes to simple AI-powered automations.
- Test how prompt changes affect output within n8n.

**Topics:**
- Setting up AI nodes in n8n for text generation and analysis.
- Building basic workflows (caption generator, subject line optimizer, FAQ bot).

**Exercises:**
- Build an n8n workflow that uses an OpenAI node to generate social captions from blog titles.
- Experiment with prompt variations to compare outputs.

**Sample Questions:**
- **Basic:** What effect does adding hashtags as a requirement in your prompt have on AI-generated captions?  
- **Intermediate:** How could you engineer a prompt to get product descriptions in a minimalist vs. detailed style?

## üéØ MODULE 4: LLM Output Control & Advanced Prompt Tuning
**Objectives:**
- Engineer prompts to control output style, length, tone, and specificity.
- Use prompt engineering to improve response quality in marketing tasks.

**Topics:**
- Prompt experimentation: iterative tuning for better results.
- System messages vs. user prompts.
- Bias, context, and role instructions.

**Exercises:**
- Tune prompts for generating:
  - An email draft  
  - A concise subject line  
- Create prompts that instruct an agent to summarize reviews based on sentiment.

**Sample Questions:**
- **Intermediate:** Craft two prompts ‚Äî one that produces a formal email draft, another a casual promotional message.  
- **Intermediate:** Why does ‚Äúsummarize in three key bullet points‚Äù produce different output from ‚Äúsummarize concisely‚Äù?

---

## üîó MODULE 5: Integrated AI Agents (Intermediate Level)
**Objectives:**
- Combine prompt engineering with n8n integrations (APIs, databases, notifications).
- Test prompt effectiveness with external data sources and workflows.

**Topics:**
- n8n workflow integrating LLM plus Google Sheets, Slack, CRM.
- Handling dynamic, real-world data in prompts.

**Exercises:**
- Build an agent to generate personalized emails using information from Google Sheets.
- Engineer prompts to tailor messages based on customer segment.

**Sample Questions:**
- **Intermediate:** What are the challenges and solutions when summarizing competitor activity using prompts that process scraped web data?  
- **Advanced:** Propose a prompt that turns raw campaign data into actionable insights for a marketing report.

---

## üèÜ MODULE 6: Assessment & Capstone Challenge
**Objectives:**
- Demonstrate proficiency by designing, testing, and iterating prompts in practical n8n agents.

**Activities:**
- **Capstone Project:** Build an n8n workflow for automated social post scheduling with LLM-powered summaries, using real data.  
- **Peer Review:** Share workflow and prompt iterations, compare outputs, and discuss improvements.

**Assessment Questions:**
- How did you refine your prompt based on output feedback?  
- What integration did you choose for external data, and how did it affect your prompt design?  
- Critique a peer‚Äôs prompt for clarity, context, and output relevance.
